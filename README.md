# Password Hashing Application


About the Project

JumpCloud has implemented a password hashing application in Golang. This application supports 3 end points 

  ○ A POST to /hash should accept a password. It should return a job identifier immediately. It should then wait 5 seconds and compute the password hash. 
  
  ○ A GET to /hash should accept a job identifier. It should return the base64 encoded password hash for the corresponding POST request.
  
  ○ A GET to /stats should accept no data. It should return a JSON data structure for the total hash requests since the server started and the average time of a hash request in     milliseconds.
  
This software should be able to process multiple connections simultaneously. The software should support a graceful shutdown request. Meaning, it should allow any
in-flight password hashing to complete, reject any new requests, respond with a Service Unavailable and shutdown.No additional password requests should be allowed when shutdown is pending.

Built With
  
  ○ SHA152 algorithm


Getting Started

Prerequisites

1. Set up the PORT to 8088 under Environment Variables
 
2. Download and install 7zip
https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

3. Curl for Windows or Gitbach

Installation

For Windows

1. Either Click on url : https://s3.amazonaws.com/qa-broken-hashserve/broken-hashserve.tgz 
or
Go to powershell and run the command “iwr -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/qa-broken-hashserve/broken-hashserve.tgz -UseBasicParsing -o ./broken-hashserve.tgz”
2. This creates a file “broken-hashserve.tgz”
3. Unzip “broken-hashserve.tgz” file using 7zip. Extract the files and it will creates folder with “broken-hashserve.tar” file 
4. Unzip the broken-hashserve.tar” file and this create a folder with application versions for each OS. For ex: windows have “broken-hashserve_win.exe
5. Run the broken-hashserve_win.exe 
6. Open new CMD window after PORT variable is created

Interacting with the Password Hashing Application

You can interact with the application using curl. The following are examples that would/should generate similar returns - the job identifier does not need to conform to a specification.
●  To Post to the /hash endpoint
Use the below commandto POST 
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"password\":\"angrymonkey\"}" http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash
Application will display the job identifier as 1 for the first job 
● To Get the base64 encoded password
Use the following command
$ curl -H "application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash/1
Application will display a hash. For example see the below
> zHkbvZDdwYYiDnwtDdv/FIWvcy1sKCb7qi7Nu8Q8Cd/MqjQeyCI0pWKDGp74A1g==
● To Get the stats
Use the below command
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/stats
Application will display TotalRequests along with AverageTime as below in JSON format 
> {"TotalRequests":3,"AverageTime":5004625}
● To Shutdown the application use the below command
curl -X POST -d "shutdown" http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash
Application will shutdown
